    <h1>Autistic Words with Jason</h1>
    <div id="words-container">
        <h2>

            I once asked my brother to define a <dfn class="word" data-word="couple">couple</dfn> words for me. He told
            me that people are too loose with the definitions of words such as few, many, or <dfn class="word" data-word="now">now</dfn>. Unfortunately, I was about to disappoint him with my lack of vocabulary policing. First, I asked him about the duality within <dfn class="word" data-word="life">life</dfn> and <dfn class="word" data-word="love">love</dfn>. Then, we chatted about why <dfn class="word" data-word="work">work</dfn> is
            often prefaced by “have to.” Our conversation was the product of an <dfn class="word" data-word="autistic">autistic</dfn> genius and a shadow artist. Nonetheless, <dfn class="word" data-word="creativity">creativity</dfn> was born. I’d say it was a <dfn class="word" data-word="success">success</dfn>.
